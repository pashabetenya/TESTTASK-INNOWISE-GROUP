  - A single image of the pokemon from the front;
  - The Pokemon's "types" e.g. grass;
  - The Pokemon's weight in kg;
  - The Pokemon's height in cm;
  - The page should also have some form of back button to go back to the list.
- Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data not loading, errors, etc).
- Data should be cached in the database to support offline mode.
  
Requirements:
  
- BLoC. 
- Use your own design for the application.
