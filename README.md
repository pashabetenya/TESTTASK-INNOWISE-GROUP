# TESTTASK-INOWWISE-GROUP.
A test assignment, received from the Innowise Group. Position St. Flutter Developer.

## Instructions:
  
- Create a simple application to view pokemons.
  
## Minimal functionality:
  
- List should display pokemon names from REST APi. List should support pagination.
  - At this point, I haven't.
- When a user clicks on cell, then the details screen is opened.
- The Pokemon details page will use the REST API, and show the next information:
  - The Pokemon's name;
  - A single image of the pokemon from the front;
  - The Pokemon's "types" e.g. grass;
  - The Pokemon's weight in kg;
  - The Pokemon's height in cm;
  - The page should also have some form of back button to go back to the list.
- Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data not loading, errors, etc).
  - Moments.
- Data should be cached in the database to support offline mode.
  - Was connected caching, now there is a correction to connect the database.
  
Requirements:
  
- BLoC. 
- Use your own design for the application.
- Code should support Unit-testing.
- Clean Architecture.
  - I tried it, but it didn't quite work, so I took it out. Maybe at some point I'll come back to the project and write the changes on this point.
